            Grizzly bears are a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos) and are primarily found in North America. Brown bears, their broader species group, are distributed across various regions worldwide. While grizzlies are most common in Alaska, western Canada, and parts of the northwestern United States, brown bears are also found throughout Europe and Asia. Countries like Russia, Romania, and parts of Scandinavia have healthy brown bear populations thriving in dense forests and mountainous regions. <br>
            <br>In some remote parts of Siberia, brown bears can grow exceptionally large due to abundant food sources. The bears in these regions exhibit behaviors similar to North American grizzlies, such as foraging for berries, hunting fish, and digging for roots. Despite regional differences, all brown bears, including grizzlies, play a crucial role in their ecosystems by dispersing seeds and helping to maintain healthy soil. Conservation efforts have helped stabilize some populations, though habitat loss and human conflict remain ongoing challenges around the globe.
